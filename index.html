        <p>The pacmen factory project allows the user to add pacmen to the screen by clicking the add button. Once the start button is clicked, the pacmen will move around the screen and bounce off the edges using edge detection. In the future I would like to have the pacmen flip the way they face based on the direction they are moving. I would also like to add some background color. This project was completed through MIT xPro full stack development with MERN professional certificate in coding.</p>

        <p>My task for eye projects was to add a second “eye” element and have that element follow the mouse position on the screen using the mouse events. I updated the position of the first eye and added the second. The eyes will follow the mouse as it moves on the screen. In the future I would like to tweak the size and color of the eyes as well as the background.

        <p>This project maps a bus route using longitude and latitude coordinates between MIT and Harvard. It cycles through a new position every second. The marker goes from MIT to Harvard and back to MIT. Once the marker reaches MIT it displays an alert that you have arrived back at MIT. I changed the original color of the marker to orange.
            Once you open the site, you click on the button at the top left to watch the marker move to each position. In the future I would like to expand on this project by adding some options for the user that would allow them to choose their desired bus route and to also have a stop button so the marker would stop at a certain location. Adding some estimated times for different bus routes would also be a good option. This project was completed through MIT xPro full stack development with MERN professional certificate in coding.</p>

        <p>For this project I created bouncing balls with different speeds that change direction when they hit the edge of the page.
            This project was created as part of the MIT xPro Coding Certification in Full Stack Development with MERN.</p>
